You need to copy these files in 1080i folder:

DialogVideoInfo.xml
Includes_Furniture.xml
Variables.xml

Unzip the file media.zip and place "media" folder in the root of the skin folder, overwriting the existing files.

With all this you're going to have:

- Atmos and DTS:X recognized and relative flags
- Metacritic ratings as in the pics in my previous post
- Rotten Tomatoes ratings as in this post (when they will work again) http://i.imgur.com/53TUEkI.jpg

When RT ratings will be again available I will make some little improvement, now without seeing them it's impossible.

Again my gratitude goes to Hustler1337, jurialmunkey and KODser for the help and/or the base of this mod.

Let's keep it updated and better !
